# super-resolution_microscopy

This is the demonstration of the results from "DLBI: Deep learning guided Bayesian inference for structure reconstruction of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy", including the full-resolution super-resolution images, videos and the used datasets.

• real1.avi: Movie of the first real-world dataset (Actin1).

• real2.avi: Movie of the second real-world dataset (Actin2).

• real3.avi: Movie of the third real-world dataset (ER).

• real1.png: Large-field reconstruction of the yellow area from the first real-world dataset (Actin1).

• real2.png: Large-field reconstruction of the yellow area from the second real-world dataset (Actin2).

• real3.png: Large-field reconstruction of the yellow area from the third real-world dataset (ER).

• CC.png: Overlap of the reconstruction images by DLBI (in red) and PALM (in green) (Actin1).

And real1.tif, real2.tif and real3.tif are the corresponding original high-density fluorecent images.

Please note that the real datasets real1.tif, real2.tif and real3.tif are distributed under providing of Professor Xu and Professor Zhang (http://ear.ict.ac.cn/?page_id=207). People who what to use them alone should also cite the paper "Rational design of true monomeric and bright photoactivatable fluorescent proteins".
